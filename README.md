## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages (see installation section)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RITESH2127/HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-TOOL.git
   cd HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-TOOL
   ```

2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib numpy
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **First, train the machine learning models:**
   ```bash
   python GAIL_PROJECT.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Load or generate the housing dataset
   - Train 8 different ML models
   - Select the best performing model
   - Save it as `best_model.pkl`

2. **Launch the Streamlit web application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - The app will automatically open in your default web browser
   - If not, navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## üìä Dataset & Features

The application uses 13 housing features based on the Boston Housing Dataset:

| Feature | Description | Range |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **CRIM** | Per capita crime rate by town | 0.0 - 90.0 |
| **ZN** | Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft | 0.0 - 100.0 |
| **INDUS** | Proportion of non-retail business acres per town | 0.5 - 27.0 |
| **CHAS** | Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise) | 0 or 1 |
| **NOX** | Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million) | 0.3 - 0.9 |
| **RM** | Average number of rooms per dwelling | 3.0 - 9.0 |
| **AGE** | Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 | 2.0 - 100.0 |
| **DIS** | Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres | 1.0 - 13.0 |
| **RAD** | Index of accessibility to radial highways | 1.0 - 24.0 |
| **TAX** | Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000 | 187.0 - 711.0 |
| **PTRATIO** | Pupil-teacher ratio by town | 12.0 - 22.0 |
| **B** | 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town | 0.0 - 400.0 |
| **LSTAT** | % lower status of the population | 1.0 - 38.0 |

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models

The application tests multiple algorithms and automatically selects the best performer:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Elastic Net**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

Each model uses standardized features through scikit-learn pipelines for optimal performance.

## üí° Usage Instructions

1. **Input Features**: Enter values for all 13 housing features using the input fields
2. **Tooltips**: Hover over the info icons (‚ÑπÔ∏è) to see detailed descriptions and valid ranges
3. **Predict**: Click the "Predict House Price" button to generate a prediction
4. **Result**: The predicted house price will be displayed in dollars

### Example Usage:
- Set Crime Rate to 0.1 (low crime area)
- Set Rooms per Dwelling to 7.0 (spacious homes)
- Adjust other features based on the property characteristics
- Click "Predict House Price" to see the estimated value

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"'best_model.pkl' not found" error:**
- Run `python GAIL_PROJECT.py` first to train and save the model

**Import errors:**
- Install missing packages: `pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib numpy`

**Port already in use:**
- Use a different port: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502`

**Network connectivity issues (original script):**
- The current `GAIL_PROJECT.py` works offline with synthetic data
- If you have the original version that requires internet, it's saved as `GAIL_PROJECT_ORIGINAL.py`

## üîÑ Development

### To modify the application:

1. **Update features**: Modify the input fields in `streamlit_app.py`
2. **Add new models**: Update the `model_dict` in the training script
3. **Change styling**: Modify the CSS in the `st.markdown` sections
4. **Update validation**: Adjust min/max values for input fields

### Model Performance:
The application automatically selects the best model based on Mean Squared Error (MSE). Typical performance metrics:
- **Best Model**: Usually Linear Regression or Ridge Regression
- **R¬≤ Score**: ~0.97 (97% variance explained)
- **MSE**: ~4.6 (low prediction error)
